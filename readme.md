# mc-get

A console application to download and install mods and modpacks for Minecraft or a Minecraft server

> [!NOTE]
> This readme is for the development version, it may differ from the latest release. You can view the readme for the latest release [here](../v0.3.1/readme.md).

## Modding Platform Support

Supports downloading from the two major modding platforms [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/)!\
ðŸš§ CurseForge is WIP and not supported in any release yet. In order to test it in main branch, you need to set the urls in [CurseForge.cs](MCGet/Platforms/CurseForge.cs) and add api key handling yourself ðŸš§

> [!NOTE]
> Only supports installing mods in the .minecraft directory at the moment (But it is planned to add the ability to fully manage multiple modpacks and installations!). In the meantime, have a look at this [list of awesome projects](https://github.com/modrinth/awesome) and see if something there fits your needs.
