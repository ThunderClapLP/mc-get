# mc-get

A console application to download and install mods and modpacks for Minecraft or a Minecraft server

> [!NOTE]
> This readme is for the development version, it may differ from the latest release. You can view the readme for the latest release [here](../v0.3.1/readme.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking change from 0.3.x: mc-get no longer installs modpacks in the .minecraft folder directly! It now supports managing multiple concurrent Minecraft installations.

## Modding Platform Support

Supports downloading from the two major modding platforms [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/)!\
ðŸš§ CurseForge is WIP and not supported in any release yet. In order to test it in main branch, you need to set the urls in [CurseForge.cs](MCGet/Platforms/CurseForge.cs) and add api key handling yourself ðŸš§
